I made a simple GUESS THE NUMBER GAME using python.
In this game you have to figure out the two digit guessed number.
If you are smart enough to find a three digit number. Then just change the value of the assigned variable "digit" to "digit = 3" in the code.
Then you will be good to go to play this game with a three digit number.
